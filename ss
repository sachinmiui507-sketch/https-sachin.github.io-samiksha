<h1>Samiksha ji…</h1>

<p>I don’t know if I still have the right to be heard,<br>
but my heart couldn’t stay silent anymore.</p>

<h2>I’m Sorry 💔</h2>

<p>
Sometimes I overdo things…<br>
Sometimes I react more than I should…<br>
Sometimes I fail to understand your silence.<br><br>

And in all of that — I hurt you.<br>
Not intentionally. Never carelessly.<br>
But I did… and I am truly sorry.
</p>

<h2>Our Maths Quiz Moments 📖</h2>

<p style="font-style:italic; color:#cc0066;">
“Sachin ye wala samjha do na…”<br><br>

Those weren’t just questions for me.<br>
Those were the moments where I started caring for you
more than I ever planned to.
</p>

<h2>You Are Special ✨</h2>

<p>
You became my comfort,<br>
my favourite notification,<br>
my calm in chaos.
</p>

<p>
I am not forcing you to come back.<br>
I just want you to know that<br>
I am changing… because you were right.
</p>

<h2>If One Day… 🌸</h2>

<p>
If your heart ever feels a little soft again,<br>
you will find me as a better listener,<br>
a calmer person,<br>
someone who truly learned your value.
